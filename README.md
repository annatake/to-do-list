# to-do-list
A simple To-Do list, inspired by [developedbyed](https://github.com/developedbyed)'s [vanilla javascript To-Do List](https://github.com/developedbyed/vanilla-todo)

I have added modifications and creative touches to make it my own, by experimenting with CSS filters and gradients to achieve a glassmorphism style.

Check out the **live preview** [here](https://annatake.github.io/to-do-list/)!

## Skills I Learned
* Using javascript event listeners to dynamically add/check/delete todo items when clicking a button
* Converting todo list data to JSON and utilize local storage to persist the todo list items
* Updating local storage items when todo item is added or deleted
* Toggling class names
* Adding filter feature to filter todo items by completed or incomplete state

## Future Improvements
- [x] Add persistence to checked-off todo items
- [ ] Move checked-off todo items to the bottom of the list 
- [ ] Add ability to select date to have todo item completed by
- [ ] Re-design app UI to include the above features if needed
